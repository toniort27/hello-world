Shed a light on me

A couple of months into the pandemic I realized that I wanted to change my career path, more so, I NEEDED to change my career path. I was feeling down with the general aspects and ways of being a lawyer and with so much free time on my hands (lost my job because of the pandemic) I thought it was time to learn something new. 

That's how I got into web development. Learning HTML showed me that I was able to accomplished anything I set my mind into so after learning the basics of HTML, I started digging about Data Analysis. Couple of months in and a lot of study and practice, I am now a Google Certified Data Analyst. I am very proud of myself and what I've done but I also know that I'm just starting the path so there's alwas more to learn, things to practice and crafts to comprehend. In the meanwhile I keep thinking to myself that no matter how long the journey is or how long it takes for me to finish it, I just have to keep moving forward.
